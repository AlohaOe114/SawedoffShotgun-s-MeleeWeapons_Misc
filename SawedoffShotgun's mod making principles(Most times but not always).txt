# Universal mod making principle:

1. Make things fit the Vanilla/CE and RealLife environment(20-21st century most). Avoid Defing Overpowered or Over-weakened things.
2. Compared with Tynan, this author is a little bit more in sticking to the reallife, to the real datas, when comes to Thing stats Def(At the "1." basis).

3. Write more and detailed comments(Defing things stats) at the Author's wish (A good habit. but not easy to insist on. \*shrug\*)
